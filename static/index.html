            <h4>Instructions (for the host's eyes only!)</h4>
            <p>
              As host, you will play the part of {{investigator}}. Your guests will play the parts of the suspects.
              It is up to you to interrogate them over the course of the evening, revealing the sometimes shocking
              connections hidden within this quiet community, and ultimately solving the murder.
            </p>
            <p>
              As {{investigator}}, you already have all the pertinent information about the victim, the {{location}}, and
              your suspects. You even know whodunnit. In effect, you hold all the cards. But tonight is your chance for
              some theatre, for a dramatic reveal. Tonight is the night you unmask a killer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your hapless suspects know none of this - until you choose to reveal it in the course of your
              investigators, casting aspersions and uncovering guilt. Initially, each player knows only those
              few bullet points of information provided below under each name.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the game, players are allowed to keep any or all of their bullet points a secret - but they
              must not directly lie about it, obscure it, or deny it when accused. It's your job to draw them out,
              spark accusations, enflame tensions, and trick your suspects into incriminating themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Read everything carefully before you hand out individual suspect information to your guests!</p>
